# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

env:
  I18N_BRANCH: i18n-preview

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
# Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
